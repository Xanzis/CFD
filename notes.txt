CFD modelling notes


General architecture (hopefully):
- C-based high-performance backbone to the code with a python wrapper
- Python implementation of the modelling algorithms in C, for handling one-off computations like boundary geometries and later post-processing.
- Possibly: HTML for visulaization and final product? Would be nice to get some experience there again.

Roadmap and planning
- Book covering a basic overview of CFD algorithms as well as optimizations and explanation of turbulence modelling, combustion CFD etc.

- Read and take notes. Once outline of a simulator is clear, write a program to implement. Progress with upgrades and optimizations along with the book.

- Book addressing the computational side of things:

Programmerâ€™s tutorial for a fluid dynamics project - probably a good jumping-off point:

- Work in more specific experimental programs for the real final project - design of the LF engine
